# **Understanding Cloud Computing: A Simple Overview**

### **What is the Cloud?**

The **cloud** is like renting someone else’s powerful computers (called servers) to store data and run programs instead of keeping everything on your personal computer or company servers. 

Instead of worrying about buying, maintaining, and scaling your own servers, you use servers provided by a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. They take care of everything for you, and you pay for what you use.

### **How Do Websites Work?**

Imagine you're visiting a website. Here's what happens:

1. **Client and Server**:  
   - Your device (e.g., phone, laptop) acts as a **client**.
   - The website you're accessing is hosted on a **server** somewhere in the world.

2. **How Data Travels**:  
   - Your client sends a request (like typing a website URL).  
   - The request is routed through a **network** (think of it as the internet highway).  
   - The **server** receives the request, processes it, and sends the information (like the website content) back to your client.

**Analogy**:  
Imagine writing a letter (request) and mailing it to a friend (server). Your letter travels through a postal network (internet). When your friend gets it, they read it, write back, and send their reply.

### **What is Inside a Server?**

A server is like a powerful computer with specific parts:
1. **CPU**: Acts like the "brain" for calculations and processing.  
2. **RAM**: Temporary memory to handle active tasks quickly.  
3. **Storage**: Long-term memory for files or databases.  
4. **Networking Tools**: Help connect to other computers or clients.

**Analogy**:  
- CPU + RAM = Your brain thinking and remembering things quickly.  
- Storage = Your long-term memory, like a notebook to save ideas.  

### **How Things Worked Before the Cloud**

In the past, businesses used their own servers. Here's how it looked:
1. **Home Setup**: Small startups (like Google) began with servers in a garage.  
2. **Data Center**: As they grew, they moved servers to bigger rooms called **data centers**.

### **Problems with Old Systems**
1. **High Costs**: Rent, electricity, cooling, and maintenance were expensive.  
2. **Scaling Issues**: Adding more servers took time and space.  
3. **Disaster Risks**: Power outages, fires, or natural disasters could wipe out data.  
4. **24/7 Monitoring**: Companies needed a team to handle server issues all the time.

### **What Does the Cloud Solve?**

The **cloud** simplifies everything:
1. **No Physical Space Needed**: You rent servers from cloud providers instead of buying them.  
2. **On-Demand Resources**: Add or remove resources (like storage or servers) instantly.  
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use, just like paying for water or electricity.  
4. **Global Access**: Your data is available anywhere, and cloud providers handle backups.  
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Cloud providers handle disasters with multiple backups and safety measures.

### **Analogy: The Cloud vs. Old Systems**

**Old Way**:  
Owning a car. You pay for maintenance, gas, insurance, and repairs, even if you only drive it occasionally.

**Cloud Way**:  
Using a ride-sharing service. You don’t own the car but pay only when you use it, and the company takes care of everything else.

### **Why is the Cloud Important?**

- It's fast, flexible, and cost-effective.
- It lets businesses focus on what they do best (like building apps or websites) without worrying about managing physical servers.

In the next lecture, you'll learn more about how the cloud works and its benefits!

# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Overview

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a global service in AWS that helps securely control access to AWS resources. It allows you to manage **users**, **groups**, and their **permissions** effectively.

## Key Concepts:
1. **Root User**:  
   - The root user is created when you set up your AWS account.  
   - It has full control over all resources but should only be used for initial setup. Avoid using or sharing the root account for day-to-day tasks.

2. **Users**:  
   - Represents an individual within your organization.  
   - Each user gets unique credentials to log in to AWS.  

3. **Groups**:  
   - A way to organize users with similar roles.  
   - For example:
     - **Developers Group**: Includes users who work as developers.
     - **Operations Group**: Includes users responsible for operations tasks.  
   - Groups simplify permissions management and can only contain users (not other groups).  

4. **Permissions and Policies**:  
   - Permissions define what actions users or groups can perform on AWS services.  
   - These are assigned through **IAM Policies**, which are JSON documents describing the allowed actions.  
   - Example Policy:
     ```json
     {
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": ["ec2:DescribeInstances", "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers"],
       "Resource": "*"
     }
     ```
     The above policy allows users or groups to view (but not modify) EC2 instances and load balancers.

### Best Practices:
- **Least Privilege Principle**:  
  Assign users and groups only the permissions they need to perform their tasks. This minimizes security risks and prevents accidental misuse of resources.  

- **Group Usage**:  
  Use groups to simplify permission management instead of assigning permissions directly to individual users.  

### Example Use Case:
Imagine a company with the following employees: Alice, Bob, Charles, David, Edward, and Fred.  
- **Developers Group**: Alice, Bob, and Charles are developers who need access to manage EC2 instances.  
- **Operations Group**: David and Edward work in operations and require permissions to monitor resources using CloudWatch.  
- Fred works independently and is assigned specific permissions directly (not best practice, but supported).

IAM ensures that each individual only has access to the AWS resources they need, keeping the environment secure and organized.

---


# IAM Policies

An **IAM policy** is like a set of rules written in a structured format (JSON) that defines what actions users or groups in AWS can or cannot perform on specific resources. Let’s break it down step-by-step and use examples to make it clear.

### **1. Policies Applied to Groups and Users**

- Imagine you have:
  - A **Developers group** with Alice, Bob, and Charles.
  - An **Operations group** with David and Edward.
  - A standalone user Fred who is not in any group.

**Group Policies**  
If you attach a policy to the Developers group, **all members** of the group (Alice, Bob, and Charles) will automatically inherit the permissions defined in that policy.  
Similarly, a policy attached to the Operations group will apply to both David and Edward.

**User-Specific (Inline) Policies**  
For Fred, who is not in a group, you can create an **inline policy**—a policy directly attached to that specific user. This means Fred has permissions that no other user or group influences.

**Multiple Groups and Policies**  
Charles and David could belong to another group, say the **Audit team**, with its own policy.  
- **Charles** inherits permissions from both the Developers and Audit team policies.  
- **David** inherits permissions from both the Operations and Audit team policies.

This shows how policies can overlap, and a user’s final permissions come from all policies applied to them.

### **2. Structure of an IAM Policy**

IAM policies are written in JSON format and include these parts:

1. **Version**  
   - The version of the policy language. For example, `2012-10-17` is the most common and current version.

2. **ID** (optional)  
   - A unique identifier for the policy. It’s helpful for tracking but not required.

3. **Statements**  
   - The core part of the policy. Each statement has several components:
   
     - **Sid (Statement ID)**: A unique identifier for the statement (optional).
     - **Effect**: Defines whether the statement **allows** or **denies** access.  
       Example: `"Effect": "Allow"` or `"Effect": "Deny"`.
     - **Principal**: Specifies **who** the policy applies to.  
       Example: `"Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root" }`.
     - **Action**: Lists the API actions that are allowed or denied.  
       Example: `"Action": "s3:PutObject"` (allows adding files to an S3 bucket).
     - **Resource**: Specifies the AWS resources the actions apply to.  
       Example: `"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"` (applies to a specific S3 bucket).
     - **Condition** (optional): Adds conditions for when the policy is applied.  
       Example: Allow access only during specific hours or from specific IP addresses.

### **3. Example Policy**
Let’s say you want to allow a user to upload files to a specific S3 bucket.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowS3Upload",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice"
      },
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Effect**: Allows the action.  
- **Principal**: Specifies this policy applies to Alice.  
- **Action**: Alice can perform the `s3:PutObject` action (upload files).  
- **Resource**: Applies to all objects in `my-bucket`.

### **4. Key Concept: Least Privilege**

AWS recommends giving users and groups only the permissions they need to perform their job—no more, no less. This is called the **least privilege principle**.  
For example:
- If Alice only needs to upload files to an S3 bucket, don’t allow her to delete or modify files.

---

### **What is a Database?**
A **database** is like a structured container for data. It helps you store, organize, and retrieve data efficiently. For example, think of a school storing student information. Instead of saving each student’s info in separate files, a database organizes it into tables, making searching or updating data faster.

### **Why Use a Database Instead of Files?**
Storing data as individual files (e.g., on S3 or EBS) works for basic storage, but databases provide structure:
- They allow for **indexes** to search quickly.
- They define relationships between data (e.g., linking students to their departments).
- They scale better when dealing with large datasets.

### **Types of Databases**

#### 1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**:  
These organize data into **tables** with rows and columns, just like Excel spreadsheets.  
- **Key Feature**: Relationships between tables.  
  Example:
  - A **Students** table with columns like ID, Name, and Department.
  - A **Departments** table with columns like Department ID and Name.
  - You can link these tables by matching the Department ID.

- **Language**: SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to query (search) the data.
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - Applications needing structured data with relationships.
  - Examples: Financial systems, school databases, or online stores.

- **Examples on AWS**:
  - Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): A managed service for databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

#### 2. **NoSQL Databases**:  
These are more flexible and are designed for modern applications. They don’t use tables and rows but instead use formats like JSON.  
- **Key Feature**: Flexibility in how data is structured.  
  Example: Instead of fixed columns, you can have nested data:
  ```json
  {
    "Name": "John",
    "Age": 30,
    "Cars": ["Ford", "BMW", "Fiat"]
  }
  ```
  - You can add new fields (e.g., "Hobbies") later without breaking the database.

- **Benefits**:
  - **Scalability**: Easier to add servers (horizontal scaling).
  - **High Performance**: Optimized for specific data types.
  
- **Types of NoSQL Databases**:
  - **Key-Value Stores**: Simple data retrieval by key. Example: DynamoDB.
  - **Document Databases**: Store data as JSON. Example: MongoDB.
  - **Graph Databases**: Model relationships (e.g., social networks). Example: Amazon Neptune.
  - **In-Memory Databases**: Super-fast data access. Example: Redis or Amazon ElastiCache.
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - Real-time applications like gaming, IoT, or social networks.
  - Examples on AWS: Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon ElastiCache.

### **AWS Managed Databases**:  
AWS offers **managed database services**, which means AWS handles the underlying tasks like scaling, backups, patching, and monitoring.  
- **Why Choose Managed?**
  - **Ease of Use**: Quickly set up without worrying about underlying servers.
  - **High Availability**: Designed for uptime across multiple zones.
  - **Automation**: Handles backups, restores, and upgrades.

- **Example**:
  - Amazon RDS (for SQL-based databases).
  - DynamoDB (for NoSQL).
  - Amazon Aurora (for high-performance relational databases).

### **Self-Managed Databases on EC2**:  
You can also install and run databases on an EC2 instance. However, you’ll need to handle:
  - Backups.
  - Security patches.
  - Scaling.
  - High availability.
  
For most users, a **managed database** is a better choice unless you need custom configurations.

### **Relational vs. NoSQL Comparison**

| **Feature**              | **Relational (SQL)**                  | **NoSQL**                         |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Structure**             | Tables with rows and columns         | Flexible, often JSON-based        |
| **Relationships**         | Strong, predefined relationships     | Less rigid, more flexible         |
| **Scaling**               | Harder to scale horizontally         | Easy to scale horizontally        |
| **Use Case**              | Structured data with relationships   | High-performance modern apps      |
| **Examples on AWS**       | Amazon RDS, Aurora                   | DynamoDB, ElastiCache             |

### **Shared Responsibility for Databases on AWS**
- **AWS Handles**:
  - Infrastructure.
  - Backup and restore.
  - Security patching.
  - High availability.
  
- **You Handle**:
  - How the data is structured and queried.
  - Access controls and application design.

### **Summary**
1. Databases are structured tools to store and retrieve data efficiently.
2. **Relational Databases**: Best for structured data with relationships (e.g., school records).
3. **NoSQL Databases**: Best for flexible, modern applications (e.g., social media or real-time systems).
4. AWS provides **managed database services** to save time and effort.
5. Choose the database type based on your application’s needs.

### Docker

#### **What is Docker?**
Docker is like a box where you can package your app along with everything it needs to work (like libraries, settings, and dependencies). This "box" is called a **container**. The magic of Docker is that this container can run on any computer, anywhere, and it will behave exactly the same way.

**Example:**  
Imagine you want to bake cookies. If you give someone your recipe and ingredients, they might not bake the same cookies because their oven or tools are different. But if you send them pre-made cookies in a sealed container, they’ll always taste the same, no matter where they are.

---

#### **Why Use Docker?**
1. **Compatibility:** The app runs the same way everywhere, no matter the operating system or machine.
2. **Efficiency:** Containers share resources with the computer they run on, making them faster and lighter than traditional methods.
3. **Scalability:** You can easily add or remove containers as needed, making it great for apps that need to handle a lot of users quickly.

---

#### **How Docker Works with AWS (EC2 Example)**
- An EC2 instance is a virtual machine on AWS. Think of it like renting a computer from AWS.
- On this EC2 instance, you can install Docker.
- Once Docker is installed, you can run multiple containers on the same EC2 instance:
  - One container might run a **Java app**.
  - Another container might run a **Node.js app**.
  - Another might store your data using **MySQL**.

Since Docker containers are lightweight and don’t need a full operating system, you can run many of them on one EC2 instance, saving time and resources.

---

#### **Docker Images and Repositories**
- **Docker Image:** A blueprint for creating a container (like a recipe for making cookies).
- **Docker Repository:** A storage space where Docker images are kept. 
  - **Public Repository:** Docker Hub (anyone can access it).
  - **Private Repository:** Amazon ECR (for private images).
 
---

#### **Docker vs. Virtual Machines**
- A **virtual machine (VM)** uses a full operating system, making it heavier and slower.
- Docker containers are lightweight because they share the host’s OS.
  - **VM Example:** Renting separate houses (with kitchens) for each dish you cook.
  - **Docker Example:** Cooking all dishes in one shared kitchen (faster and uses fewer resources).

---

### ECS, Fargate, and ECR

#### **What is ECS?**
**ECS (Elastic Container Service)** is a service from AWS that helps you run Docker containers in the cloud. Think of it as a manager that places and runs your containers (the "apps in a box" from Docker) on virtual machines.

Here’s how it works:
1. **EC2 Instances:** You need to create virtual machines (EC2 instances) in advance to run the containers.
2. **Container Placement:** ECS automatically decides which EC2 instance will run each container, depending on the available resources.
3. **Integration:** ECS can work with services like an Application Load Balancer, which helps distribute traffic evenly if you’re running a web app.

**Example:**  
Imagine you’re hosting a food delivery app, and ECS is the kitchen manager who decides which chef (EC2 instance) will cook each dish (Docker container). You need to set up the chefs in advance, but ECS organizes the work for you.

---

#### **What is Fargate?**
**Fargate** is another AWS service for running Docker containers, but it’s **serverless**. This means:
1. You **don’t need to set up EC2 instances** (no managing virtual machines).
2. You just tell AWS how much CPU and memory each container needs, and Fargate runs it for you.

**Key Differences from ECS:**
- In ECS, you manage the infrastructure (create EC2 instances).  
- In Fargate, AWS manages everything. You only focus on the containers.

**Example:**  
Imagine the food delivery app again, but now Fargate is like a cloud kitchen where you just send the recipes (container configurations) and ingredients (images from ECR), and AWS handles the cooking (running containers) without you worrying about the chefs.

---

#### **What is ECR?**
**ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** is a storage space for your Docker images on AWS.  
Think of it as a **private library** where you keep the "recipes" (Docker images) for your apps.

Here’s how it works with ECS and Fargate:
1. **Store Images in ECR:** You upload your Docker images to ECR.
2. **Run Containers:** ECS or Fargate can pull these images and create containers.

**Example:**  
For the food delivery app, ECR is like a fridge where you keep pre-packaged meals (Docker images). ECS or Fargate takes the meal from the fridge and prepares it for delivery (runs the container).

---

### **Quick Comparison**
| Feature            | ECS                       | Fargate                   |
|--------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Infrastructure** | You manage EC2 instances. | AWS manages everything (serverless). |
| **Setup Effort**   | More effort (provision servers). | Easier (focus on containers). |
| **Use Case**       | Better for more control.   | Better for simplicity.     |

---

**Summary:**  
- **ECS**: You run containers on EC2 instances you manage.  
- **Fargate**: You run containers without managing any servers (serverless).  
- **ECR**: A storage space for your Docker images that works with both ECS and Fargate.

Both ECS and Fargate let you run Docker containers on AWS, and you store Docker images in ECR for either service.

---

### Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
### **What is Kubernetes?**
- **Kubernetes** is a system that helps you manage and run **containers** at scale. 
- Containers are like **mini-apps** that package everything an application needs (like code, libraries, and system tools) to run anywhere. It’s like putting your app in a **box** that can be moved and run on any computer.
  
**Example**:  
Imagine you have a website that runs in a container. Kubernetes helps you automatically manage and scale many of these containers to handle more users or move them between computers.

---

### **Why Do We Use Kubernetes?**
Kubernetes makes it easier to:
- **Deploy** (put your app into containers).
- **Scale** (increase or decrease the number of containers based on traffic).
- **Manage** (monitor, restart, and update containers automatically).

Think of it as a **manager** that takes care of running your containers smoothly without you having to worry about the details.

---

### **What is Amazon EKS?**
- **Amazon EKS** is a **managed service** that makes it easier to run Kubernetes on AWS.
- Setting up Kubernetes manually can be complex, but EKS takes care of the hard parts for you. With EKS, you don’t have to worry about setting up the **Kubernetes control plane** (the part that manages the entire system). AWS does that for you.

---

### **How Does EKS Work?**
- When you use Amazon EKS, you still work with **Kubernetes**, but AWS manages the setup and maintenance.
- **EKS Nodes** are EC2 instances (virtual machines) where your containers will run.
- When you launch a container in **EKS**, Kubernetes will automatically place it into a **pod** and assign it to one of your EC2 instances or use **Fargate** (a serverless option that removes the need for managing servers).

---

### **Why Use Amazon EKS?**
1. **Ease of Use**:  
   - Kubernetes is powerful, but setting it up and managing it can be difficult. EKS makes it easier by handling most of the setup and maintenance for you.

2. **Cloud Agnostic**:  
   - Kubernetes works on many platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or even on-premises). So, learning Kubernetes allows you to deploy containers anywhere.
   
   **Example**: If you have an app running in Kubernetes on AWS and later decide to move it to Google Cloud or Azure, you won’t need to change the way your app is packaged or managed. Kubernetes makes it **portable**.

---

### **Summary**
- **Kubernetes** is an open-source tool for managing containers, making it easier to deploy, scale, and manage applications.
- **Amazon EKS** is a managed service that runs Kubernetes on AWS, handling the setup and management for you.
- Use EKS when you need to run containerized applications in a **scalable and flexible** way on AWS, without dealing with the complexity of Kubernetes setup.

---

By using **EKS**, you get the power of Kubernetes without the headache of managing it yourself. It’s perfect for running modern, containerized applications, especially if you plan to scale or use multiple cloud platforms.

---

### Elastic Beanstalk Simplified

**Elastic Beanstalk (EB)** is an AWS service that simplifies deploying and managing applications. It helps you focus on your code while it automatically handles the infrastructure setup for you—like creating servers, storage, load balancers, and scaling configurations.

---

#### Key Features of Elastic Beanstalk

1. **Two Types of Environments:**
   - **Web Server Environment:** Runs a website or web application.
   - **Worker Environment:** Processes background tasks (e.g., working on tasks from a queue).

2. **Automatic Infrastructure Creation:**
   When you deploy an application, Beanstalk automatically creates:
   - **EC2 instances:** Virtual machines where your app runs.
   - **Auto Scaling Groups:** To manage how many instances are running.
   - **Elastic IPs:** Public IPs to access your application.
   - **Security Groups:** Rules to control access to your resources.

3. **Prebuilt Platforms:** 
   Choose your application runtime, like Node.js, Python, or Java, from a list of managed platforms. You can use AWS-provided sample code to get started.

4. **Environment Management:** 
   Applications can have multiple environments, such as `development` (for testing) and `production` (for end users).

5. **Configuration Flexibility:** 
   Beanstalk provides preset configurations:
   - **Single Instance Mode:** Simple setup for testing (free tier eligible).
   - **High Availability Mode:** For production, includes load balancing and multiple instances.
   - **Custom Configuration:** Advanced setup for experienced users.

---

#### How Elastic Beanstalk Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Create an Application:**
   - Choose the environment type (e.g., Web Server).
   - Name your application (e.g., `MyApplication`).
   - Assign an environment name (e.g., `MyApplication-dev` for development).

2. **Select a Platform:**
   - Pick a platform like Node.js for your app's runtime.
   - Use default settings for simplicity.

3. **Deploy Code:**
   - Start with AWS's sample code if you don’t have your code ready.

4. **Set Up IAM Roles:**
   - Beanstalk needs permissions to create and manage AWS resources. You may need to manually create an **EC2 role** (e.g., `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role`).

5. **Launch Application:**
   - Beanstalk sets up resources like EC2, Elastic IP, and Auto Scaling Groups in the background.

6. **Access Your Application:**
   - Beanstalk generates a public domain name for your app. Open it to see your app running (e.g., "Congratulations, you are now running Elastic Beanstalk on this EC2 Instance").

---

#### What Happens Behind the Scenes?

- **CloudFormation:** Beanstalk uses AWS CloudFormation to create the resources (like EC2 instances, load balancers, etc.). You can monitor the progress of resource creation in the Events tab or directly in the CloudFormation console.
- **Auto Scaling:** Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand (optional for single instance mode).

---

#### Why Use Elastic Beanstalk?

- **Easy Deployment:** Just upload your code, and AWS handles the rest.
- **Scalable:** It automatically adjusts to handle more traffic if needed.
- **Environment Management:** Test your app in multiple environments (e.g., `dev`, `prod`) easily.
- **Integrated Monitoring:** Beanstalk provides logs, health checks, and performance metrics in its dashboard.

---

#### Example Use Case

You want to deploy a Node.js web app for your startup. Using Elastic Beanstalk:
1. Upload your app code or use AWS's sample Node.js app.
2. Beanstalk creates an EC2 instance and sets up networking for your app.
3. You receive a public domain (e.g., `myapp.elasticbeanstalk.com`) to access your website.

Later, if your app grows, Beanstalk can add more EC2 instances to handle increased traffic automatically.

---

#### Cleaning Up Resources

When you’re done experimenting:
1. Go to the Beanstalk dashboard.
2. Select your application and delete it to avoid unnecessary costs.

Elastic Beanstalk simplifies the process of deploying and scaling applications, making it ideal for developers who want to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure.

### Amazon Kinesis

Amazon Kinesis is an AWS service used to **collect, process, and analyze data in real-time**. Think of it as a way to handle a constant stream of data (like a river) coming from various sources and doing something useful with it immediately, instead of storing it and analyzing it later.

---

### What is Real-Time Streaming?

Imagine a live video feed or a constant flow of temperature readings from sensors. These are examples of **real-time data**—data that is generated continuously and needs to be processed quickly to make timely decisions.

---

### Key Features of Amazon Kinesis

1. **Real-Time Big Data Streaming**: 
   - Kinesis is designed for handling large amounts of data that arrive continuously.
   - Examples: Monitoring stock market changes, analyzing IoT sensor data, or processing website clicks.

2. **Managed Service**: 
   - AWS handles all the setup and scaling, so you don’t have to worry about managing servers.

---

### Components of Amazon Kinesis

Kinesis has several sub-services to handle different tasks:

#### 1. **Kinesis Data Streams**
   - **What it does**: Collects and ingests real-time data from multiple sources like sensors, log files, or websites.
   - **Example**: A fleet of delivery trucks sends GPS data continuously to Kinesis Data Streams. 

#### 2. **Kinesis Data Firehose**
   - **What it does**: Takes the data from Kinesis Data Streams and sends it to storage or analytics tools like:
     - **Amazon S3**: To store data.
     - **Amazon Redshift**: For advanced analytics.
     - **Elasticsearch**: For searching and monitoring logs.
   - **Example**: The truck GPS data is stored in an S3 bucket to create monthly delivery performance reports.

#### 3. **Kinesis Data Analytics**
   - **What it does**: Analyzes the data in real-time using SQL (a language for querying data).
   - **Example**: Analyze the truck GPS data in real-time to detect delays or find the fastest routes.

#### 4. **Kinesis Video Streams**
   - **What it does**: Processes real-time video feeds for monitoring or analysis.
   - **Example**: A security system that analyzes live camera footage to detect motion or recognize faces.

---

### Why Use Kinesis?

1. **Real-Time Insights**:
   - Helps you act immediately on new data instead of waiting hours or days.
   - Example: A news website adjusts its front page in real-time based on trending topics.

2. **Scalable**:
